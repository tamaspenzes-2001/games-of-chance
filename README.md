# games-of-chance

A terminal casino game based on this Codecademy project: https://www.codecademy.com/projects/practice/games-of-chance

You start with 100 dollars. You can make Coin Flip, Cho-Han, Card Draw or Roulette bets to try your luck, win (or lose) money based on your bet amount.

**Coin Flip:** Bet for heads or tails.
**Cho-Han:** Two dices are rolled, the resulting numbers are summed. Bet for an even or odd sum.
**Card Draw:** You and your opponent draw a card. If yours is higher, you win.
**Roulette:** A ball is throwed onto a double zero roulette board. See which field it stops on. You can make various types of bet. You can make an outside bet for lower (1-2x) payout but lower risk of losing (even, odd, red, black etc.). Or if you're feeling confident, you can make an inside bet for much higher (5-35x) payout but much higher risk of losing a significant amount of money (single number guess, 0, 00, split, corner etc.)
